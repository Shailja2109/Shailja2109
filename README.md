<p align="center">
In 2020, I graduated with distinction in Computer Engineering and subsequently embarked on a career as a Software Developer. Over the course of four years within the realm of Tech-IT Software Development Companies, I have honed my expertise in various domains, including Full Stack Development, Cloud Services, and gained valuable experience in AI and Machine Learning. Additionally, I have demonstrated proficiency in crafting 3D Web Applications.

I'm left-handed with the core characteristic of being creative. It's hard to drag me away from my addiction to solving the things I'm onto. I like to go againest the trends and laws and work, thinking out of the box.
